## Agenda for today

- Introduction to basic concepts for coding in R
- Getting a flavour of R syntax and style
- Setting up R and reproducible environment on your personal computer

## R and RStudio

- R is a free and open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
- RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for coding in R.
  - An IDE is a set of tools that helps you code.
- We use RStudio to write our R codes.

## R packages

- R packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code.
- They can include functions, data, or both, along with documentation.
- Think of them as plug-ins that enhance the functionality of existing software.
- For example, web browser extensions like ad blockers add additional features that the original browser doesn't have.

## Reproducible environment

- An environment is the system where a program is run, including hardware and software such as operating system dependencies, programming language, packages, their configuration, and versions.
- Just as running 1000 meters affects individuals differently, running code on different computers or with different package versions can produce varied results.
- A reproducible environment ensures that everyone gets the same result by keeping the environment consistent.

## `renv` package

::: {.column width="60%"}
- `renv` is an R package that helps create reproducible environments for R projects.
- It records the R version and all R packages along with their versions in a lockfile.
  - A lockfile is a text file that stores all the environment information.

## Code hosting and Github

::: {.column width="85%"}
- Code hosting involves storing code online to facilitate sharing, management, and collaboration with others.
- One of the most popular code hosting platforms is GitHub (owned by Microsoft).
- Both the textbook and the companion R package used in this course are hosted on GitHub.
- GitHub is like a cloud drive (similar to OneDrive or Dropbox) but specialized for storing code, including R scripts.

## R Markdown vs. R

:::: {.columns}

![](./images/create_r_markdown.png){height=500px}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- R Markdown is a file format that combines R code, its results, and accompanying text.
- It uses the file extension `.Rmd` and essentially is a plain text file integrating markdown and R.
- You can start by creating an `Rmd` file on the lab computer.

## R Markdown syntax

```{=html}
<style>
div[data-code-copy="false"] button.code-copy-button {
  display: none;
}
</style>
```

::: {code-copy="false"}

````{verbatim}

1. **YAML header**: stores settings or meta information
2. **Markdown text**: contains plain text in markdown format.
3. **R code chunk**: contains R code to be executed

## R basics: arithmetic operations

You can start by trying out R on the lab computer. Later, we'll set it up on your personal computer.

R can be used as a calculator, using intuitive symbols for these operations:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
1 + 5
8 - 3
3 * 4
9 / 3
```

## R basics: assigning values

One of the cornerstones of programming languages is assignment. You can assign a value/object to a name using `<-` (suggested R style) or `=` ("Python" style).

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- 1
b <- 3
a + b
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
c = 7
d = 5
c * d
```

## R basics: built-in functions

R comes with many built-in functions. The calling syntax is `function(parameter1, parameter2, ...)`. Additionally, with extra R packages, there are even more functions you can use.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
values <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
sum(values)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(values)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(MASS)
# integrate the sin function from 0 to pi.
area(sin, 0, pi)
```

## R basics: indexing

Indexing is the process of selecting specific values from an object based on their index location. Whenever you see `[]` or `$` in R, some form of indexing is happening.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
```

```{r}
as.data.frame(v) |> t() |> knitr::kable(row.names = F)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
v[2]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
v[2:4]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
v[c(TRUE, T, T, T, T, TRUE,
    FALSE, F, FALSE, F)]
```

## R basics: indexing

```{r, echo=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(col1 = c(1, 2, 3),
                 col2 = c(4, 5, 6))
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(df)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
df[1, 2]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
df[, "col2"]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
df$col1
```

## R basics: flow control

Flow control is an important component of any programming language. In R, the `if-else` statement and loops work as follows:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x <- 6
if (x > 5) { 
  print("Greater than 5") 
} else {
  print("Less or equal to 5")
}
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
for (i in 1:3) {
  print(i)
}
```

## R basics: custom functions

To define your own function in R, you can use the following syntax. Note that the last line of code is automatically returned by R, though a "Python" style return statement is also valid in R.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
add <- function(a, b) { 
  a + b
}

add(1, 4)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
add <- function(a, b) { 
  return(a + b)
}

add(1, 4)
```

## Download R version 4.4.2

## Restoring the environment

Download the `Applied-Spatial-Statistics` zip file from Avenue and unzip it. You should then have a folder with the following structure:

<!---
Generated using https://tree.nathanfriend.io

Text used:

- Applied-Spatial-Statistics
  - renv/
  - .gitignore
  - .Rprofile
  - Applied-Spatial-Statistics.Rproj
  - README.md
  - README.Rmd
  - renv.lock
  
--->

```
Applied-Spatial-Statistics/
├── renv/
├── .gitignore
├── .Rprofile
├── Applied-Spatial-Statistics.Rproj
├── README.md
├── README.Rmd
└── renv.lock
```

- Double-click the `Applied-Spatial-Statistics.Rproj` file to open the R project.

## RTools 4.4 for Windows users

[mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/CRAN/bin/windows/Rtools](https://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/CRAN/bin/windows/Rtools/)

![](./images/rtools.png){height=150px}

- Ensure you download the `Rtools` version that matches your installed R version.
- Rtools is a set of programs required on **Windows** to build R packages from source.
- Note: If you are using Mac or Linux, Rtools is **not** required.

## Xcode and GNU Fortran for Mac users

[mac.r-project.org/tools](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/)

![](./images/xcode.png){height=350px}

- In order to compile R for macOS, you will need **both** Xcode and GNU Fortran compiler.

## Homebrew and GDAL for Mac users

Next, use macOS Terminal to install Homebrew, and subsequently, GDAL.

[brew.sh](https://brew.sh/)

[formulae.brew.sh/formula/gdal](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gdal)

- Navigate to the bottom right panel.
- Click the Packages tab, then the renv button, and finally select the `Restore Library` option.
- Click the `Restore` button in the pop-up panel.

## Install $\LaTeX$

$\LaTeX$ is a high-quality typesetting system. While it may seem as a language, understanding it isn't necessary for our purposes. We will use it to export `Rmd` files with results into PDF files.

If you already use $\LaTeX$ and have it installed through `MiKTeX` or `TeX Live`, you can skip this step.

If you are unfamiliar with $\LaTeX$ and don't have it installed yet, simply run the following R code to install it:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

## Lab slides

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%"}

```{=html}
<p>
<img src="./images/qr_code.svg" style="width:100%;"/>
</p>
```

:::

::: {.column width="65%"}

- You can access all the lab slides by scanning the QR code or by visiting the URL directly.

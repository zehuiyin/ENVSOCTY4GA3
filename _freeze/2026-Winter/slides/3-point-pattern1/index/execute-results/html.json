The points are located within a unit square ranging from 0 to 1.\n\n- A random process: $Prob(Event_{(x,y)}) = B(n = 1, p = 0.5)$\n- A deterministic process:<br>$Prob(Event_{(x,y)}) = x$\n- A stochastic process: $Prob(Event_{(x,y)}) = x - x \\cdot B(n = 1, p = 0.5)$\n\n## Generate random values from a distribution\n\nThere is a family of functions that start with `r*` capable of generating random values from a given distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nFrom a nomral distribution:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrnorm(n = 5, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  0.5185718 -0.5801848  1.7541242 -1.4321465 -1.3573983\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom a binomial distribution:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrbinom(n = 5, size = 1, prob = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0 1 0 1 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese functions are very useful for simulations.\n\n## Random number generator and seed\n\nIn computers, there is no true random number generator; they all use pseudo-random number generators. This means that the random numbers produced by computers are just the output of a very complex function based on an input, or seed.\n\nAs a result, if we know the seed, we can perfectly predict the random numbers generated by a computer's random number generator.\n\nTypically, computers use the current time as the seed (R uses this approach).\n\n## Setting a seed in R\n\nYou can control the random number generation algorithm by setting a seed value in R.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(437988)\nrbinom(n = 5, size = 1, prob = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 0 0 0 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(437988)\nrbinom(n = 5, size = 1, prob = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 0 0 0 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the seed in R is actually a vector, a sequence of values, and `set.seed` changes this vector to a particular state.\n\nIf you do not set the seed again before rerunning the second `rbinom`, it will produce different results.\n\n## What is $p$-value?\n\nLet's say we have two samples from two different distributions. We want to perform a statistical test to compare their means ($H_1: \\overline{x_1} \\neq \\overline{x_2}$). The $p$-value is the area under the curve that is more extreme than the test statistic, multiplied by 2.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=3000}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Online Office Hours\n\nIf you need additional help, especially while working on your course project, you're welcome to book a 15- or 30-minute online office hour with me.\n\nPlease email me at **yinz39@mcmaster.ca** with a brief **description of your question** and several **possible meeting times**.\n\nI'll follow up to confirm the appointment and share a Zoom link.\n\n## Activities for today\n\n- We will work on the following chapter from the textbook:\n  - Chapter [8](https://paezha.github.io/spatial-analysis-r/activity-3-maps-as-processes.html): Activity 3: Maps as Processes\n  - Chapter [10](https://paezha.github.io/spatial-analysis-r/activity-4-point-pattern-analysis-i.html): Activity 4: Point Pattern Analysis I\n- The hard deadline is **Tuesday**, **January 27** (**8:00 am**).\n",
